For this final project, I was interested in incidents of crime that occurred in the city of Chicago from 2020 to 2023​. To look into this interest, I obtained the Crime dataset from the Chicago Data Portal. This Dataset contained reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.​ To protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. ​

Some of the research questions I was interested in include:
R1: What were the different types of crimes during Covid-19 Pandemic (2020) and Post-Pandemic(2023)?​
R2: What was the predominant type of crime prevalent in Chicago between 2020-2023?​
R3: What proportion of crimes in Chicago between 2020-2023 resulted in arrests?​
R4: What certain types of crimes are more likely to occur during specific months?​
